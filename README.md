# NLU-second-assignment
Second assignment of the course Natural Language Understanding @ UNITN.

## Requirements
The repository was structured in a way to make it easy to run the code directly on Google Colab, so as to minimize the configuration on your local machine, so please refer to it. Note that in the default visualization of the notebook on GitHub, the NER visualization of Spacy does not work properly. So I suggest to open the Colab link to see the correct NER plots.

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/steveazzolin/NLU-second-assignment/blob/main/code/NLU_second_assignment.ipynb)

However, in case is needed, I list here the explicit requirements:
- SpaCy 3.0.3 (running a different version may result in different results)

## Repo structure
- *data/*: directory containing train/val/test datasets
- *code/*: reference to the Colab notebook. The report is embedded in the notebook, exploting the nice property of notebooks to combine both code and text
